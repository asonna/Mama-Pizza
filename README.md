## Description
This site will be used to collect users pizza order and return to them a summary receipt of their order. The following specifications were completed as part of building the site:
* _Design an HTML page and use CSS to format it_
* _If item is clicked, the corresponding cost will be returned as part of the total cost calculation._
* _1st spec: Started by writing a user interface function to return value of any clicked item from the meat section.
input: Bacon
output: 2_
* _2nd spec: Then expanded to return value of any clicked item from both the meat and the veggie section.
input: Ham and mushroom
output: 2 and 1 repectively_
* _3rd spec: created business interface prototypes:
  - to collect all meat elements value and return then in a form of an array.
  input: bacon, ham and chicken wings
  output: 2,2,2
  - to collect all veggie elements value and return then in a form of an array.
  input: spinach, Onion and Green Pepper
  output: 1,1,1_
* _4th spec: create user interface equation to execute above two prototypes
* _5th spec: create prototype for the total cost of one pizza
input: size(large)=7; allMeatCost(bacon, ham) = 4; allVeggieCost(Spinach) =1;
output:_pizzaTotalCost = 7+4+1 = 12
* _create user interface equation to execute the total cost of one pizza_
